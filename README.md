Question: Can I combine miso paste with brussel sprouts?

Answer: Yes, miso paste can be combined with brussel sprouts to make a delicious side dish. The Foodie Physician's recipe for Miso-Roasted-Brussels-Sprouts-2266030 provides a great example of how to do this. The recipe calls for roasting the sprouts with oil, salt, and pepper first to get them crispy. Then, the sprouts are tossed with the miso glaze and returned to the oven for a few minutes to caramelize. It is important to keep an eye on them as the glaze can burn quickly (The Foodie Physician-Miso-Roasted-Brussels-Sprouts-2266030).

Miso paste can also be used in other recipes that include brussel sprouts. For example, Little Spice Jar's Kale-Shaved-Brussel-Sprout-Salad-With-Ginger-Miso-Dressing-9437915 combines chopped kale and shaved Brussels sprouts with roasted peanuts, shredded cabbage, and leftover chicken or turkey, topped with a ginger miso dressing. The dressing is made with miso paste, ginger paste, lime juice, sesame oil, rice vinegar, oil, sugar,
